# Marvel_characters_clustering

In this work, our aim is to employ unsupervised learning techniques to identify hidden patterns among Marvel characters. Superheroes are representative of a society's desires and aspirations, thus being an interesting topic for social research. In order to shed light on such aspirations and societal ideals, we will exploit both Clustering Analysis and Categorical Principal Component Analysis.
